# The Homer Multitext project

> *A purely personal site about how I work with the Homer Multitext project's digital archive*.



The Homer Multitext project has been the main focus of my digital scholarship in the twenty-first century. I'm continuing to contribute to the project since being promoted to Professor Emeritus, and am using this site to 
present some of my ongoing work.

## Published data sets

- [published releases](./publication/) of HMT data sets

## The data sources

- the [github archive](./archive/)
- [binary image data](./images/)


## Julia code
